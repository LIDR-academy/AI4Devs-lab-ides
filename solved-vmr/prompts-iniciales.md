Check the files of the project and explain the structure

As a senior software developer, I will begin development while adhering to the standards of this project for an ATS system. The first use case to be developed will be:

As a recruiter,
I want to have the ability to add candidates to the ATS system,
So that I can manage their data and selection processes efficiently.

To achieve this, I will start by defining some guidelines and rules that the system will follow. Function Accessibility: There must be a clearly visible button or link to add a new candidate from the recruiter’s main dashboard page.

Data Entry Form: When selecting the option to add a candidate, a form should be displayed, including the necessary fields to capture the candidate's information, such as first name, last name, email, phone number, address, education, and work experience.

Data Validation: The form must validate the entered data to ensure completeness and correctness. For example, the email must have a valid format, and mandatory fields should not be left empty.

Document Upload: The recruiter should have the option to upload the candidate’s CV in PDF or DOCX format.

Now I need improvements: Addition Confirmation: Once the form is completed and the information is submitted, a confirmation message should appear indicating that the candidate has been successfully added to the system.

More improvements: Function Accessibility: There must be a clearly visible button or link to add a new candidate from the recruiter's main dashboard page.

With this in mind, we should create a homepage with two buttons: "Add Candidate" and "List Candidates."

Clicking the "Add Candidate" button should navigate to the candidate creation page.
Clicking the "List Candidates" button should navigate to a new page displaying the complete list of candidates with all columns visible.

Add in both pages a boton to return to dashboard "ATS Dashboard Manage your candidates efficiently"

I need a improvement, at the list of candidates, i want a button to order the colums

Change the field education to a list of options the educations

Apply a design in the button "Upload"

When mouse over the list apply a better UX and designe

Accessibility and Compatibility: The functionality must be accessible and compatible with different devices and web browsers. Include an accessibility option on the page with a dark mode
