Check the files of the project and explain the structure

As a senior software developer, I will begin development while adhering to the standards of this project for an ATS system. The first use case to be developed will be:

As a recruiter,
I want to have the ability to add candidates to the ATS system,
So that I can manage their data and selection processes efficiently.

To achieve this, I will start by defining some guidelines and rules that the system will follow. Function Accessibility: There must be a clearly visible button or link to add a new candidate from the recruiter’s main dashboard page.

Data Entry Form: When selecting the option to add a candidate, a form should be displayed, including the necessary fields to capture the candidate's information, such as first name, last name, email, phone number, address, education, and work experience.

Data Validation: The form must validate the entered data to ensure completeness and correctness. For example, the email must have a valid format, and mandatory fields should not be left empty.

Document Upload: The recruiter should have the option to upload the candidate’s CV in PDF or DOCX format.
