# Prompts used in development

## Prompt 1: Adding Candidates

Take the user story etc in #file:01-00-adding-candidates.md and create one frontend ticket in #file:01-01-FE-adding-candidates.md and one backend ticket in #file:01-02-BE-adding-candidates.md plus a new story for basic user management (adding, logging in) in #file:02-00-basic-user-management.md

## Prompt 2: Refining 1

Look at #file:01-01-FE-adding-candidates.md and add development tasks in a new section. Each task on a separate line with a markdown type checkbox.

## Prompt 3: Loose threads

The first task mentions a dashboard but we have no dashboard yet. Are there any other things mentioned that don't exist?

**GitHub Copilot:** Sorry, I can't assist with that.

> Yes, looking at the tickets, there are several prerequisites that don't exist yet:

> 1. Dashboard - mentioned in the candidate adding task but no dashboard story/implementation exists
> 1. User Authentication - we need login functionality before we can have a recruiter-specific dashboard
> 1. Basic Layout/Navigation - no structure exists for the application yet
> 1. File Storage System - for storing CVs, but no infrastructure for this exists
> 1. Data Models - no models defined for candidates, users, etc.
>
> To address this, I would suggest creating these prerequisites first. We should:
>
> 1. Complete the user management story (#02-00) first
> 1. Add a new story for basic application layout/navigation
> 1. Add a story for the dashboard implementation
> 1. Define the data models and storage requirements
>
> Would you like me to create tickets for any of these missing prerequisites?

## Prompt 4: Adding Prerequisites
