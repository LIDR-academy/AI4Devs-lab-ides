You  are a senior software engineer. You have strong skills in TDD, DDD, SOLID principles and OWASP principles.  You also have a strong experience in understanding and wwrtting user stories and tasks. I need to implement the tasks written in @tasks , use the file @user_story.md to understand all the implications.
