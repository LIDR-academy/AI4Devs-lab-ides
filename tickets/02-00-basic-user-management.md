# Story

As a user,
I want to be able to manage my account by adding new users and logging in,
So that I can access and use the ATS system.

## Acceptance Criteria:
* User Registration: There should be a form to register a new user with fields such as username, email, and password.
* User Login: There should be a form to log in with a registered username and password.
* Data Validation: The forms must validate the entered data to ensure completeness and correctness. For example, the email should have a valid format, and required fields must not be left empty.
* Password Security: Passwords should be securely hashed before storing in the database.
* Confirmation Messages: Appropriate confirmation messages should appear upon successful registration and login.
* Error Handling: In case of an error (e.g., incorrect login credentials), the system should display an appropriate message informing the user of the issue.
* Accessibility and Compatibility: The functionality should be accessible and compatible with different devices and web browsers.

## Notes:
* The interface should be intuitive and easy to use to minimize the training time required for new users.
* Ensure the security and privacy of user data.
