# let get to work. i am a senior developer, and i need to create a web interface for our HR department, this web must have a button to add candidates 

# instead of a resume URL, i want to add the option to upload candidate resume

# that was perfect. finally, i want a table with several education examples, and i want that information to be of choice of the candidate in the form. and the same for position input

# delete the add example education option, i only want the candidate to be able to add its custom education experience, so delete the table as well because i don't need it
